This repo contains the term project on course Introduction to Machine Learning Autumn 2024 at University of Helsinki.
Term project was based on GeckoQ data set that had roughly 32 000 atmospherically relevant molecules with 24 variables. 
Our task was simply to train best possible prediction model on this data set of atmospheric measurements for log_pSat_Pa(response). 
Our best solution would then be evaluated and compared and ranked against solutions by other groups in Kaggle Competition organised 
by the course personnel. We went on to explore the data first, carry out feature engineering, try out different models that we learned 
during the course, evaluate our models performance on chosen metrics and finally perform model selection with what we would take part 
in the competition.

Authors of this repo are Simo Liimatta and Kim St√•hlberg.


We have removed from the repo the original data used, since we were not allowed to make it public. Therefore, what you can find 
in this repo is the methodology, the code we used for EDA, feature selection and model selection, as well as the report of the 
findings and selected models.
