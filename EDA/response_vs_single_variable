Read data

```{r}
train_kaggle <- read.csv("train_kaggle.csv")
```

## Exploratory data analysis


Our response variable is log_pSta_Pa.

For starters we modeled each explanatory variable against our response variable to see if we can drop some variables in this phase.


#### Model each variable against response

```{r}
# Get the names of predictor variables (excluding the response)
predictor_names <- names(train_kaggle)[-which(names(train_kaggle) == "log_pSat_Pa")]

# Loop through each predictor
for (predictor in predictor_names) {
  # Create the formula dynamically
  formula <- as.formula(paste("log_pSat_Pa ~", predictor))

  # Fit the linear model
  model <- lm(formula, data = train_kaggle)

  # Print the summary
  print(summary(model))

  # Optional: Add a separator between model outputs
  cat("\n--------------------\n\n")
}
```

#### Analysis

We decided to drop all variables that had adjusted R-squared < 0.01.

We dropped following variables: numOfConfUsed, C.C..non.aromatic., C.C.C.O.in.non.aromatic.ring, aldehyde, ester, ether..alicyclic., nitrate, nitro, aromatic.hydroxyl, peroxide and nitroester.
